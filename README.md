<p>I am a mid-level <b>front-end developer</b> with over 4 years of experience in the tech industry. Before transitioning to programming, I worked for more than 10 years as an <b>advertiser</b> and <b>graphic designer</b>, which provided me with a strong foundation in UI and UX. This unique blend of skills allows me to approach tech solutions with a distinct perspective, prioritizing functionality, aesthetics, and user experience.
I have designed and developed interfaces for websites and apps, combining technical and creative expertise to deliver impactful results. Currently, I am part of a telecommunications project, where I work with <b>React, TypeScript,</b> and the <b>single-spa</b> architecture. My daily work involves tools like <b>Ant Design</b> (AntD), <b>WebSocket</b>, and <b>MobX</b>, and I also have previous experience with <b>React Native</b> for mobile development.
In addition to my technical expertise, I have strong soft skills: I am resilient, highly focused, and deadline-driven. I excel at teamwork and have clear and effective communication skills, which help me collaborate productively and contribute to a harmonious work environment.
Driven by challenges and a passion for growth, I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations to expand my impact in the tech field.
